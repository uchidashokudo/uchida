👋&nbsp;Uchida Eatery will be selling onigiri 🍙 (rice balls) this Saturday (Oct. 22nd) as part of the tea festival at Nootka Court. We'll be selling at the door and pausing online orders for the day. Come out to the festival and we hope to see you there! 

Our normal schedule will resume next week. We appreciate your understanding.
