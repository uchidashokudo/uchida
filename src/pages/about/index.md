  As much as possible, we source our vegetables, fish and meat from nearby farms
  and waters.


  We are proud to prepare fresh vegetables daily from Uminami Farm, located
  Southwest of us in Metchosin.

### 

### Opening in 2012, Uchida Shokudo/Eatery serves authentic Japanese cuisine with an emphasis on locally sourced ingredients.



At Uchida Eatery, we have been serving handcrafted Japanese cooking since 2012. We like to keep things simple, and tasty. Come in for lunch!

Pssst! We polish our white rice every day to make it as tasty as we can.
